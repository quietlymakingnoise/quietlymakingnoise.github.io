      <h3>22nd september 2017</h2>
        <p>
          Quietly Making Noise announces it's commitment to intelligent electronic music with a new EP from Brighton based producer sdxn. After establishing his arrival as a genuine production talent in 2015 with the acclaimed Only Water EP, sdxn returns with a 5 track offering of minimal electronics aimed at both open-minded dance floors and after hours stargazing.

            <h1>Turtle Dove</h1>
            <p>
              <strong>‘Turtle Dove’</strong> opens the release with a thumping 808, astral synths, and a heavy glissando bass line. Electro-acoustic touches are wistful while spaciousness and energy keep the track tough and driving. Both tender and immersive - ethereal and purpose built for 3am floors.

            </p>
            <h1>Panic!</h1>
            <p>
              ‘Panic!’ brightens the feel and dials the tempo way down for a glorious sunrise/sunset workout that weaves its way through pacific nu disco with a balearic twist. Ethereal pads lay the foundation for chiming synths that shimmer in and out of focus over a thudding kick and chopped break, and the lines pulse, flash, and fade with a beautifully nostalgic feel.
            <h1>umvdn</h1>
            <p>
          ‘umvdn’ shimmers in a dreamy intersect of classic Detroit tropes and US garage chug. A bubbly bass fizzzes around a swinging 808 drum groove, while liquid pads wash over gently rolling arpeggios and hazy vocals. In a spacious and expressive mid tempo, a longing atmosphere with a quiet but compelling energy wistfully unravels its way through 5 minutes before evaporating.
            </p>
            <h1>Thoughts Of you</h1>
            <p>
              ‘Thoughts of You’ leads the EP with both Vocal and Trumpet mixes. A cavernous off beat drum break and complex, unspooling  layers of percussion underpin  a classic gliding bass and synths that in turns chime and twinkle. James Mayhew’s melancholic, muffled trumpet and Cali Santo’s mournful and faraway vocal perfectly capture the human heart that pulses at the core of this beautiful yet functional release.
